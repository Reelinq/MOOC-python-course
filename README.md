This is my performance in MOOC python course. Instead of a test, I did project, which can be found in final_project folder. Link to the course: https://programming-24.mooc.fi/

Note, that test or other stuff si removed to make this repo contain less code. In this repo there is only answers which you have to test by downloading tmc or on the website of the course.

This course was done on August 2024 and since then I improved a lot. Do not check this repo to check my skills at coding, as it contains some very dirty and bad code, but it works =)
